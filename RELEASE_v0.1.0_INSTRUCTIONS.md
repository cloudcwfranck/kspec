## 📦 Release Contents

When the release is published, it will include:

- `kspec_0.1.0_Linux_amd64.tar.gz`
- `kspec_0.1.0_Linux_arm64.tar.gz`
- `kspec_0.1.0_Darwin_amd64.tar.gz` (macOS Intel)

- Source code archives (auto-generated by GitHub)
- README.md, LICENSE, and docs (included in archives)

## 🚀 Next Steps to Publish

You need to push the tag to GitHub to trigger the release workflow:

```bash
# Push the main branch with the release prep commit
git push origin main

# Push the v0.1.0 tag to trigger the release workflow
git push origin v0.1.0
```

## 🤖 What Happens Automatically

Once you push the tag, the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yaml`) will:

1. **Run Tests** - Execute `go test ./...` to ensure everything passes
2. **Build Binaries** - Use GoReleaser to build for all platforms
3. **Generate Checksums** - Create SHA256 checksums for verification
4. **Create GitHub Release** - Publish release with:
   - Comprehensive release notes (from `.goreleaser.yaml`)
   - All binary artifacts
   - Checksums file
   - Automatically generated changelog
5. **Make it Public** - Release will be immediately available

- Continuous monitoring with watch mode
- CronJob deployment for automation
- Drift history tracking

## 📚 Post-Release Tasks

After the release is published, you may want to:

1. **Announce the Release**
   - Share on relevant communities (CNCF Slack, r/kubernetes, etc.)
   - Write a blog post or announcement
   - Update any external documentation

2. **Monitor Release**
   - Check that all binaries built successfully
   - Verify download links work
   - Test installation on different platforms

3. **Prepare for v0.2.0**
   - Start Phase 7: Documentation website (Vercel)
   - Plan Phase 8: Advanced features (webhooks, multi-cluster, etc.)
   - Consider Homebrew formula for easier macOS installation

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

If the release workflow fails:

1. Check the [GitHub Actions logs](https://github.com/cloudcwfranck/kspec/actions)
2. Common issues:
   - **Tests failing**: Fix tests, commit, create new tag (v0.1.1)
   - **Build errors**: Check Go version compatibility
   - **Permission errors**: Ensure GITHUB_TOKEN has proper permissions

You can always delete and recreate the tag if needed:
```bash
git tag -d v0.1.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.0
# Fix the issue, then recreate and push
```

## ✨ Success Criteria

The release is successful when:
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow completes without errors
- ✅ All 5 platform binaries are available for download
- ✅ Checksums file is present
- ✅ Release notes are formatted correctly
- ✅ Binaries can be downloaded and execute `kspec version`

---

**Current Status**: ✅ All preparation complete. Ready to push and release!

**Next Action**: Push the tag to trigger the release
```bash
git push origin main && git push origin v0.1.0
```
